# Getting started with Blazor on Linux

I first developed a preference for [Linux](https://linux.org), [BSD Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)
and the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) back in the year 2000. Without a doubt I owe
my start as an IT Pro to that formative time learning my way around [Red Hat Linux](https://redhat.com), and later 
[FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org). 

Over the past twenty years I have learned a number of programming languages with various levels of proficiency and
ability to build things, but none have rivaled what I can get done with [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang). 

When it finally dawned on me that Microsoft is [actually serious about Open Source](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/)
and about taking their tools and frameworks cross-platform I knew that it would be a good investment to take 
another serious look at [.Net](https://github.com/dotnet).

Before we get much farther I just want to say that *Mi casa, mis reglas*, we'll be doing things on the command line and
the good news is that the dotnet ecosystem is great at it. 

I wrote this post as a reference for someone new to Linux, new to .Net development, new to Blazor or maybe all of the above
to help them get started. By the end of this post I hope to have given you a good starting point for firing up a new
Blazor project that you can riff on to see if it is right for you. 

But first, I know someone reading this has a few questions so let's address them.

## Why .Net? Why Blazor? Why Linux?

This is not your uncle's .Net Framework from the days when it only ran on Windows and was primarily used in business applications at
ACME Corp. to make [TPS Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPS_report) harder than they need to be for some reason.

No, this is the new [.Net](https://github.com/dotnet) and it is super duper. With .Net 5 and soon (November 2021)
.Net 6 you can write applications for (...*deep breath*...) Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Machine Learning, Internet of Things (IOT),
Web Applications, Progressive Web Apps (PWA), API and more. That's a whole lot of bang for your buck with one language (you can also use F#)
and one (it's huge) framework, all developed as open source. 

If you are trying to break into Full Stack web development these days you no doubt have seen the deluge of choices for
Javascript frameworks to make modern reactive web apps. These mean using Javascript which is meant to be an easy language
to learn, which it is, but comes with the tradeoff of some darn weird language quirks and trivia developers must know to
use it professionally. So much that Microsoft developed [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) to act as a sane way to
way to use Javascript without having to deal with Javascript.

Or, you could just do reactive web apps with Blazor which uses C# for the business logic and battle tested ASP.Net for the service. 
The experience developing in Blazor is somewhere between React and VueJS in my opinion, the ideas are functionally familiar if you
have spent time with either. You have two main options for Blazor projects, server-side (Blazor Server) and client-side (Blazor Web 
Assembly). In this post we'll be working with Blazor Server.

The server title fights have been over a while now, and the undisputed champ is Linux. These days with [Docker](https://docker.com)
you can have a new build of your application ready for deployment to a variety of supported hosting options in just a few commands.
Microsoft has official images with .Net SDK and .Net Runtime purpose built that make this a snap. I'd argue that there needs to be 
a good reason *not* to use Linux as the server to use anything else. 

Whether or not to use Linux as your main development workstation is a personal choice (if an employer isn't telling you what
to use), but not because the tools don't work or are difficult to use. To be totally transparent I do about 50% of my .Net development
on my Macbook Pro and the other half on a Laptop running Ubuntu (and tried it with a few other Distributions as well preparing for this post). 

I have done zero .Net 5 development on a Windows workstation to date, nor have I used Visual Studio at all and everything works fine.
This says a lot about quality of the tools Microsoft is putting out for .Net right now and I am optimistic about their intentions for the future.


## Getting .Net for Linux

My impression from the [official installation documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website)
is that Microsoft has focused the instructions (and probably the testing) on the more popular production Linux Distributions. 
Specifically: Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Red Hat and Ubuntu.

If you run one of the many Debian or Ubuntu Distributions (e.g. Linux Mint), the installation instructions will probably still work 
fine for you.

To install .Net SDK on your development machine, start with the page linked above, then find and click the link **Install .NET on &lt;YOUR_DISTRO&gt;**.
Check the notes in **Supported Distributions** at the top of the page, you know, to make sure it is supported, and then find the section 
titled **Install the SDK** for instructions specific to your Distribution.

Arch Linux users (and derivatives like [Manjaro](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) can install the dotnet-sdk package from the [Arch Package Respository](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=dotnet-sdk) and
Arch also has a good [.Net Wiki Page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/.NET_Core). I recommend that all Linux users look at and bookmark this page.

I did have the chance to test the installation on [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org) and had good luck with the [Scripted Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-scripted-manual#scripted-install)
instructions.

I tend to not give much unsolicited advice on things like what Linux Distribution to use, but I will make an exception here. If you are doing *paid* .Net development work
it is a good idea to stick with a distribution that gets a lot of attention, care and feeding from Microsoft like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) for your main
development machine. Your mileage may vary, it's just a suggestion. 

## Additional Setup

For the best development experience on Linux, you will want to also install [Omnisharp-Roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn)
and as a dependency you will need [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) >= 6.0.x which should be available in the packages for your Distribution.

Omnisharp-Roslyn provides the language server for C# and .Net which you will want to have while working with .Net in your editor of choice.

Speaking of which there are so many to choose from (I use [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) and [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)) 
that this is a good time to mention checking the documentation and your favorite forums and subreddits for help setting it all up for 
[Language Server Protocol - LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) and C#/.Net if you don't already know how to do those things.

You can of course get [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Linux, which is a very reasonable editor to get started quickly
and pain free. Check the packages for your Distribution and of course you can download and manually install it from Microsoft. 

You can place all of our personal preferences in your <code>~/.omnisharp/omnisharp.json</code> file. For example you can take a look
at [mine](https://github.com/olepunchy/omnisharp-settings) which formats my code to [One True Brace Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style) on save
and a couple of other things I like. Check the [Configuration Options](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/wiki/Configuration-Options) page and
these [great blog posts](https://www.strathweb.com/2020/02/hidden-features-of-omnisharp-and-c-extension-for-vs-code/) about it.

## A word about .Net and FreeBSD
There doesn't appear to be any activity from either [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or the Ports Team at
FreeBSD to bring [.Net 5](https://github.com/dotnet) to BSD-land. 

[Jason Pugsley](https://github.com/jasonpugsley) has some interesting looking [instructions](https://github.com/jasonpugsley/installer/wiki/.Net-Core-3.0.0-for-FreeBSD)
on getting .Net working under FreeBSD and might be worth a shot if you care a little more about running FreeBSD than having official
packages for .Net.

## Your first Blazor Server project

I hope you didn't have to do much googling around and have arrived at this step ready to get our sample project going.

We'll be using the command line and the first thing I want to show you is a simple way to see what kinds of projects you can
